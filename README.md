## PROJECT EXECUTION by Team 7:
The project went smooth with us, 4 talented determined computer application students that nothing can stop them to be soltion oriented and be always eager to learn and open to share knowledge.Everyone contributed in all the features listed below , yet we chose to assign a responsible for each one of them to make sure all the micro tasks are going according to our timeline and daily workload.
Nevertheless,we made sure to divide tasks between us and capitalize on each other's strenght to achieve the best version of the election machine: 
Mona was the main responsible for Login and Logout process, Vignesh was database master and finally Nazanin and Wafa were Questions/Candidate responsibles.
